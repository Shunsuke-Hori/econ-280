# Econ 280 in Julia

This repo hosts the exercise solutions for [Econ 280](http://econweb.ucsd.edu/~gramey/280.htm) written in Julia _and_ C++. Why not kill ~~two~~ three birds with one stone by learning MATLAB _and_ Julia _as well as_ C++ at the same time?? Instructions for installing Julia on your local machine [here](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform.html) or sign up with PLON and check out the [project](plon.io/explore/econ-280/DXwI9D462nlWahj8w) to use Julia without installing anything.
